        <h2>Meet Me...</h2>
          Hello there, my name is Mayowa Oluwaseyi Ojo, you can also call me
          CloudFairy!🌩️🧚‍♀️
          <br />
          I am a DevOps Engineer, a Site Reliability Engineer and a Technical
          Writer looking forward to delving into Developer Relations. I love to
          solve problems and I do it for a living.
          <br />
          I took up interest in software developent in 2020 and since then, I
          have worked on various projects that tested my skills. As time went
          by, I became more and more interested in Cloud Engineering and decided
          to learn it.<br />
          I am now a DevOps Engineer. DevOps is an interesting aspect of software and cloud
          development that helps developers and organizations work more
          efficiently. <br/>
          The several interesting topics in DevOps are more thn
          enough to keep you busy and entertained. Some of the tools and
          technology that I have been working on are: Docker, Jenkins, Ansible,
          Terraform, and Kubernetes. Does anyone sound familiar to you?
          <br />
