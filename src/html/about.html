          Hello there, my name is Mayowa Oluwaseyi Ojo, you can also call me
          CloudFairy!üå©Ô∏èüßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a DevOps Engineer, a Site Reliability Engineer and a Technical
          Writer looking forward to delving into Developer Relations. I love to
          solve problems and I do it for a living.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took up interest in software developent in 2020 and since then, I
          have worked on various projects that tested my skills. As time went
          by, I became more and more interested in Cloud Engineering and decided
          to learn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now a DevOps Engineer. DevOps is an interesting aspect of
          software and cloud development that helps developers and organizations
          work more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The several interesting topics in DevOps are more thn enough to keep
          you busy and entertained. Some of the tools and technology that I have
          been working on are: Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and
          Kubernetes. Does anyone sound familiar to you?
        </p>

        <!-- you had the closing tag somehow <h3/> vs </h3> changed it out. No biggie just pointing 
             it out so you see how easy it is to over look a lot
